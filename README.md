## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
# The fetchProducts function is an asynchronous function that fetches product data from an API endpoint.

# #The ProductContext.js file is a React component that provides a context for managing product data in a web application. Its primary purpose is to fetch and store product information from an API, and make it available to other components in the application through the React Context API.

# The DepartmentList.js code is a React component that displays a list of products with various details such as name, description, brand, cost price, quantity, and size. The component also provides functionality for selecting or deselecting individual products or all products at once.

# The code app\components\layout.js is a React component that serves as the main layout for a web application. It provides a consistent structure and styling for the entire application, including a header with a logo, search input, and user dropdown menu.

# The SearchInput.js component is a React functional component that renders a search input field. Its purpose is to provide a user interface element that allows users to search for products by entering text into the input field.

# The component does not take any direct input from the outside. However, it uses the useProducts hook to access the searchProducts function, which is likely responsible for filtering or searching a list of products based on the user's input.

# The code app\layout.js is a React component that serves as the root layout for a Next.js application. It defines the overall structure and layout of the application, which will be shared across all pages.

# the code in app\page.js sets up a React component that renders a page with a heading and a list of departments. The list of departments is initially empty but can be updated by passing search results to the handleSearchResults function, which updates the departments state. The updated state is then passed to the DepartmentList component, which renders the list of departments on the page.
